List of known issues.

Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
memory systems (eg a SAN device) a challenge.
On some NAS/SAN systems you may have to downgrade CherryPy to 2.2.1.
Remove the "cherrypy" directory inside SABnzbd and install an older
CherryPy as a Python module.


SABnzbd is not compatible with some ZoneAlarm firewall versions.
Comodo and the Windows firewall work fine.

Sometimes logging stops. This is a notorious bug in Python logging. SABnzbd will
function as normal. If you run from sources or use the --console option with the
Win32-binary, you will see that logging continues in the console window, but
nothing will be written to the log-files.
