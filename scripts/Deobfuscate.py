"""

Deobfuscation post-processing script:

Will check in the completed job folder if maybe there are par2 files,
for example "rename.par2", and use those to rename the files.
If there is no "rename.par2" available, it will rename the largest
file to the job-name in the queue.

NOTES:
 1) To use this script you need Python installed on your system and
    select "Add to path" during its installation. Select this folder in
    Config > Folders > Scripts Folder and select this script for each job
    you want it used for, or link it to a category in Config > Categories.
 2) Beware that files on the 'Cleanup List' are removed before
    scripts are called and if any of them happen to be required by
    the found par2 file, it will fail.
 3) If there are multiple larger (>40MB) files, then the script will not
    rename anything, since it could be a multi-pack.
 4) If you want to modify this script, make sure to copy it out
    of this directory, or it will be overwritten when SABnzbd is updated.
 5) Feedback or bugs in this script can be reported in on our forum:
    https://forums.sabnzbd.org/viewforum.php?f=9
