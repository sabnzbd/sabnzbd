# `git blame` master ignore list.
#
# This file contains a list of git hashes of revisions to be ignored
# by `git blame`. These revisions are considered "unimportant" in
# that they are unlikely to be what you are interested in when blaming.
# They are typically expected to be formatting-only changes.
#
# It can be used for `git blame` using `--ignore-revs-file` or by
# setting `blame.ignoreRevsFile` in the `git config`[1].
#
# Ignore these commits when reporting with blame. Calling
#
#   git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# will tell `git blame` to ignore changes made by these revisions when
# assigning blame, as if the change never happened.
#
# You can enable this as a default for your local repository by
# running
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# This will probably be automatically picked by your IDE
# (VSCode+GitLens and JetBrains products are confirmed to do this).
#
# Important: if you are switching to a branch without this file,
# `git blame` will fail with an error.
#
# GitHub also excludes the commits listed below from its "Blame"
# views[2][3].
