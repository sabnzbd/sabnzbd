-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your browser may start up with just an error page.

This means that SABnzbd cannot use the default port 8080 to run its web-server on.
Try to use another port, you'll need to use the a command window:
    SABnzbd.exe -s localhost:7777
or
    python SABnzbd.py -s localhost:7777

You may of course try other port numbers too.

For troubleshooting you can use the program SABnzbd-console.exe.
This will show a black window where logging information will be shown. This
may help you solve problems easier.
