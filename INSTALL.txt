3) INSTALL pre-built macOS binaries

Just like you do with so many apps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) INSTALL with only sources
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specific guides to install from source are available for Windows and macOS:
    https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/installation/install-macos
    https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/installation/install-from-source-windows

Only Python 3.6 and above is supported.

On Linux systems you need to install:
    par2 unrar unzip python3-setuptools python3-pip

On non-X86 platforms, for which PyPI does not provide all pre-compiled packages,
you also need to install these development libraries (exact names might differ per platform):
    libffi-dev libssl-dev

Unpack the ZIP-file containing the SABnzbd sources to any folder of your liking.

Inside the SABnzbd source directory, install all required Python packages by running:
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If you want non-English languages, you need to compile the translations.
Start this from a shell terminal (or command prompt):
    python3 tools/make_mo.py

To start SABnzbd, run this from a shell terminal (or command prompt):
    python3 -OO SABnzbd.py

Within a few seconds your web browser will start and show the user interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your browser may start up with just an error page.

This means that SABnzbd cannot use the default port 8080 to run its web-server on.
Try to use another port, you'll need to use the a command window:
    SABnzbd.exe -s localhost:7777
or
    python3 SABnzbd.py -s localhost:7777

You may of course try other port numbers too.

For troubleshooting on Windows you can use the program SABnzbd-console.exe.
This will show a black window where logging information will be shown. This
may help you solve problems easier.
