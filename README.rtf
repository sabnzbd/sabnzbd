\b What's new
\b0 \
RC2\
- Generic Sorter failed to uppercase first letter of title when starting with "the/a/to" etc.\
- Add "hidden" option allow_64bit_tools (lost when going from 0.5.6 to 0.6.0)\
- Improve handling of non-creatable final and category folders\
- Fix and I18N the "Downloaded in X days Y hours Z seconds" text in the history report.\
- Change the OSX DMG window size so that the optional "path bar" doesn't obsure part of the background image.\
RC1\
- Update Plush to solve minor browser incompatibilities\
- On Windows the 64bit versions of par2 and unrar were never used\
- Updated unrar to 4.01\
- Using the "Download" button in newzbin.com RSS feeds produced malformed names.\
- When removing job folders in the "temporary download folder", remove everything.\
  This is needed because some operating systems add spurious files and folders.\
\
- OSX has now a Leopard/SnowLeopard DMG and a Lion-only DMG\
  You can see the difference in the DMG's background image\

The organization of the download queue is different from 0.5.x.\

cannot go back to an older version without losing your queue.\
Also, your sabnzbd.ini file will be upgraded, making it\
incompatible with release 0.5.x\

Upgrading from 0.4.x
\b0\fs26 \
\

\b PLEASE DOWNLOAD YOUR CURRENT QUEUE BEFORE UPGRADING
\b0 \
\
When upgrading from a 0.4.x release such as 0.4.12 your old settings will be kept.\
You will however be given a fresh queue and history. If you have items in your queue\
from the older version of SABnzbd, you can either re-import the nzb files if you kept\
an nzb backup folder, or temporarily go back to 0.4.x until your queue is complete.\
The history is now stored in a better format meaning future upgrades should be backwards\
compatible.\
