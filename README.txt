************************  SABnzbd 0.6.9RC2  ************************

What's new:
RC2
- Generic Sorter failed to uppercase first letter of title when starting with "the/a/to" etc.
- Add "hidden" option allow_64bit_tools (lost when going from 0.5.6 to 0.6.0)
- Improve handling of non-creatable final and category folders
- Fix and I18N the "Downloaded in X days Y hours Z seconds" text in the history report.
- Change the OSX DMG window size so that the optional "path bar" doesn't obsure part of the background image.
RC1
- Update Plush to solve minor browser incompatibilities
- On Windows the 64bit versions of par2 and unrar were never used
- Updated unrar to 4.01
- Using the "Download" button in newzbin.com RSS feeds produced malformed names.
- When removing job folders in the "temporary download folder", remove everything.
  This is needed because some operating systems add spurious files and folders.

- OSX has now a Leopard/SnowLeopard DMG and a Lion-only DMG
  You can see the difference in the DMG's background image
