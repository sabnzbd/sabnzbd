Quote from the module:
"""
    This version has been extracted from the Turbogears source repository
    and slightly changed to be completely stand-alone again.
    Also some fixes have been made to make it work on Python 2.6 (sched module changes).
    The version in Turbogears is based on the original stand-alone Kronos.
