- To prevent unexpectedly large NZBs from eating your download quota you can set
  the option 'size_limit' on the Config->Special page.
  Any NZB larger than this size will be set to paused and get a low priority.

- When par2 or unrar hang up, never just stop SABnzbd.
  Instead use your operating system's task manager to stop the par2 or unrar program.
  Forcing SABnzbd to quit may damage your queues.

- Some Usenet servers have intermittent login (or other) problems.
  For these the server blocking method is not very favourable.
  There is an INI-only option that will limit blocks to 1 minute.
      no_penalties = 1

- Some third-party utilties try to probe SABnzbd API in such a way that you will
  often see warnings about unauthenticated access.
  If you are sure these probes are harmless, you can suppress the warnings by
  setting the option "api_warnings" to 0.

- On OSX you may encounter downloaded files with foreign characters.
  The par2 repair may fail when the files were created on a Windows system.
  The problem is caused by the PAR2 utility and we cannot fix this now.
  This does not apply to files inside RAR files.

- The "Watched Folder" sometimes fails to delete the NZB files it has
  processed. This happens when other software still accesses these files.
  Some third-party utilities supporting SABnzbd are known to do this.
  We cannot solve this problem, because the Operating System (read Windows)
  prevents the removal.

- Memory usage can sometimes have high peaks. This makes using SABnzbd on very low
  memory systems (e.g. a NAS device or a router) a challenge.
  In particular on Synology (SynoCommunity) the device may report that SABnzbd is using
  a lot of memory even when idle. In this case the memory is usually not actually used by
  SABnzbd and will be available if required by other apps or the system. More information
  can be found in the discussion here: https://github.com/SynoCommunity/spksrc/issues/2856

- SABnzbd is not compatible with some software firewall versions.
  The Microsoft Windows Firewall works fine, but remember to tell this
  firewall that SABnzbd is allowed to talk to other computers.

- When SABnzbd cannot send notification emails, check your virus scanner,
  firewall or security suite. It may be blocking outgoing email.

- When you are using external drives or network shares on OSX or Linux
  make sure that the drives are mounted.
  The operating system will simply redirect your files to alternative locations.
  You may have trouble finding the files when mounting the drive later.
  On OSX, SABnzbd will not create new folders in /Volumes.
  The result will be a failed job that can be retried once the volume has been mounted.

- If you use a mounted drive as "temporary download folder", it must be present when SABnzbd
  starts up. If not, SABnzbd will use the default location.
  You can make SABnzbd wait for a mount of the "temporary download folder" by setting
  Config->Special->wait_for_dfolder to 1.
  SABnzbd will appear to hang until the drive is mounted.

- If you experience speed-drops to KB/s when using a VPN, try setting the number of connections
  to your servers to a total of 7. There is a CPU-usage reduction feature in SABnzbd that
  gets confused by the way some VPN's handle the state of a connection. Below 8 connections
  this feature is not active.
