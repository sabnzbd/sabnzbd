	SMTP over SSL typical listens on port 465. Unlike StartTLS, SMTP over SSL
	makes an SSL connection before doing a helo/ehlo. All transactions, then,
	are done over an encrypted channel.

	This class is a simple subclass of the smtplib.SMTP class that comes with
	Python. It overrides the connect() method to use an SSL socket, and it
	overrides the starttles() function to throw an error (you can't do
	starttls within an SSL session).
