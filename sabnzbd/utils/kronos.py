"""Module that provides a cron-like task scheduler.

This task scheduler is designed to be used from inside your own program.
You can schedule Python functions to be called at specific intervals or
days. It uses the standard 'sched' module for the actual task scheduling,
but provides much more:

* repeated tasks (at intervals, or on specific days)
* error handling (exceptions in tasks don't kill the scheduler)
* optional to run scheduler in its own thread or separate process
* optional to run a task in its own thread or separate process

If the threading module is available, you can use the various Threaded
variants of the scheduler and associated tasks. If threading is not
available, you could still use the forked variants. If fork is also
not available, all processing is done in a single process, sequentially.

There are three Scheduler classes:

    Scheduler    ThreadedScheduler    ForkedScheduler

You usually add new tasks to a scheduler using the add_interval_task or
add_daytime_task methods, with the appropriate processmethod argument
to select sequential, threaded or forked processing. NOTE: it is impossible
to add new tasks to a ForkedScheduler, after the scheduler has been started!
For more control you can use one of the following Task classes
and use schedule_task or schedule_task_abs:

    IntervalTask    ThreadedIntervalTask    ForkedIntervalTask
    SingleTask      ThreadedSingleTask      ForkedSingleTask
    WeekdayTask     ThreadedWeekdayTask     ForkedWeekdayTask
    MonthdayTask    ThreadedMonthdayTask    ForkedMonthdayTask

Kronos is the Greek God of Time.

Kronos scheduler (c) Irmen de Jong.
This version has been extracted from the Turbogears source repository
and slightly changed to be completely stand-alone again. Also some fixes
have been made to make it work on Python 2.6 (sched module changes).
The version in Turbogears is based on the original stand-alone Kronos.
