Pure-Python interface to Apple Bonjour and compatible DNS-SD libraries

pybonjour provides a pure-Python interface (via ctypes) to Apple
Bonjour and compatible DNS-SD libraries (such as Avahi).  It allows
Python scripts to take advantage of Zero Configuration Networking
(Zeroconf) to register, discover, and resolve services on both local
and wide-area networks.  Since pybonjour is implemented in pure
Python, scripts that use it can easily be ported to Mac OS X, Windows,
Linux, and other systems that run Bonjour.

Note on strings: Internally, all strings used in DNS-SD are UTF-8
strings.  String arguments passed to the DNS-SD functions provided by
pybonjour must be either unicode instances or str instances that can
be converted to unicode using the default encoding.  (Passing a
non-convertible str will result in an exception.)  Strings returned
from pybonjour (either directly from API functions or passed to
application callbacks) are always unicode instances.

    A DNSServiceRef pointer.  DO NOT CREATE INSTANCES OF THIS CLASS!
    Only instances returned by the DNS-SD library are valid.  Using
    others will likely cause the Python interpreter to crash.

    An instance of this class represents an active connection to the
    mDNS daemon.  The connection remains open until the close() method
    is called (which also terminates the associated browse, resolve,
    etc.).  Note that this method is *not* called automatically when
    the instance is deallocated; therefore, application code must be
    certain to call close() when the connection is no longer needed.

    The primary use of a DNSServiceRef instance is in conjunction with
    select() or poll() to determine when a response from the daemon is
    available.  When the file descriptor returned by fileno() is ready
    for reading, a reply from the daemon is available and should be
    processed by passing the DNSServiceRef instance to
    DNSServiceProcessResult(), which will invoke the appropriate
    application callback function.  (Note that the file descriptor
    should never be read from or written to directly.)

    The DNSServiceRef class supports the context management protocol
    introduced in Python 2.5, meaning applications can use the 'with'
    statement to ensure that DNSServiceRef instances are closed
    regardless of whether an exception occurs, e.g.

      sdRef = DNSServiceBrowse(...)
      with sdRef:
          # sdRef will be closed regardless of how this block is
          # exited

    Register a service that is discovered via DNSServiceBrowse() and
    DNSServiceResolve() calls.

      flags:
        Indicates the renaming behavior on name conflict.  Most
        applications will pass 0.

      interfaceIndex:
        If non-zero, specifies the interface on which to register the
        service.  Most applications will pass
        kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny (0) to register on all available
        interfaces.

      name:
        If not None, specifies the service name to be registered.
        Most applications will not specify a name, in which case the
        computer name is used.  (This name is communicated to the
        client via the callback.)  If a name is specified, it must be
        1-63 bytes of UTF-8 text.  If the name is longer than 63
        bytes, it will be automatically truncated to a legal length,
        unless the flag kDNSServiceFlagsNoAutoRename is set, in which
        case a BonjourError exception will be thrown.

      regtype:
        The service type followed by the protocol, separated by a dot
        (e.g. "_ftp._tcp"). The service type must be an underscore,
        followed by 1-14 characters, which may be letters, digits, or
        hyphens.  The transport protocol must be "_tcp" or "_udp". New
        service types should be registered at
        <http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html>.

      domain:
        If not None, specifies the domain on which to advertise the
        service.  Most applications will not specify a domain, instead
        automatically registering in the default domain(s).

      host:
        If not None, specifies the SRV target host name.  Most
        applications will not specify a host, instead automatically
        using the machine's default host name(s).  Note that
        specifying a host name does NOT create an address record for
        that host; the application is responsible for ensuring that
        the appropriate address record exists, or creating it via
        DNSServiceRegisterRecord().

      port:
        The port, in host (not network) byte order, on which the
        service accepts connections.  Pass 0 for a "placeholder"
        service (i.e. a service that will not be discovered by
        browsing, but will cause a name conflict if another client
        tries to register that same name).  Most clients will not use
        placeholder services.

      txtRecord:
        The TXT record rdata.  If not None, txtRecord must be either a
        TXTRecord instance or a string containing a properly formatted
        DNS TXT record, i.e.
        <length byte> <data> <length byte> <data> ...

      callBack:
        The function to be called when the registration completes or
        asynchronously fails.  Its signature should be
        callBack(sdRef, flags, errorCode, name, regtype, domain).
        The client MAY pass None for the callback, in which case the
        client will NOT be notified of the default values picked on
        its behalf, and the client will NOT be notified of any
        asynchronous errors (e.g. out of memory errors, etc.) that may
        prevent the registration of the service.  The client may NOT
        pass the flag kDNSServiceFlagsNoAutoRename if the callback is
        None.  The client may still deregister the service at any time
        by closing the returned DNSServiceRef.

      return value:
        A DNSServiceRef instance.  The registration will remain active
        indefinitely until the client terminates it by closing the
        DNSServiceRef.

    Callback Parameters:

      sdRef:
        The DNSServiceRef returned by DNSServiceRegister().

      flags:
        Currently unused, reserved for future use.

      errorCode:
        Will be kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success, otherwise will
        indicate the failure that occurred (including name conflicts,
        if the kDNSServiceFlagsNoAutoRename flag was used when
        registering).  Other parameters are undefined if an error
        occurred.

      name:
        The service name registered.  (If the application did not
        specify a name in DNSServiceRegister(), this indicates what
        name was automatically chosen.)

      regtype:
        The type of service registered, as it was passed to the
        callout.

      domain:
        The domain on which the service was registered.  (If the
        application did not specify a domain in DNSServiceRegister(),
        this indicates the default domain on which the service was
        registered.)

    Browse for instances of a service.

      flags:
        Currently ignored, reserved for future use.

      interfaceIndex:
        If non-zero, specifies the interface on which to browse for
        services.  Most applications will pass
        kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny (0) to browse on all available
        interfaces.

      regtype:
        The service type being browsed for followed by the protocol,
        separated by a dot (e.g. "_ftp._tcp").  The transport protocol
        must be "_tcp" or "_udp".

      domain:
        If not None, specifies the domain on which to browse for

        instead browsing on the default domain(s).

      callBack:
        The function to be called when an instance of the service
        being browsed for is found, or if the call asynchronously

        kDNSServiceFlagsAdd.

      interfaceIndex:
        The interface on which the service is advertised.  This index
        should be passed to DNSServiceResolve() when resolving the
        service.

      errorCode:
        Will be kDNSServiceErr_NoError (0) on success, otherwise will

        DNSServiceResolve() call.

      regtype:
        The service type, which is usually (but not always) the same
        as was passed to DNSServiceBrowse().  One case where the
        discovered service type may not be the same as the requested
        service type is when using subtypes: The client may want to
        browse for only those ftp servers that allow anonymous
        connections.  The client will pass the string
        "_ftp._tcp,_anon" to DNSServiceBrowse(), but the type of the

        for each discovered service instance should be stored along
        with the name, so that it can be passed to DNSServiceResolve()
        when the service is later resolved.

      replyDomain:
        The domain of the discovered service instance.  This may or
        may not be the same as the domain that was passed to
        DNSServiceBrowse().  The domain for each discovered service
