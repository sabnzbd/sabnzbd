Deobfuscation post-processing script:

Will check in the completed job folder if maybe there are par2 files,
for example "rename.par2", and use those to rename the files.
If there is no "rename.par2" available, it will rename large, not-excluded
files to the job-name in the queue if the filename looks obfuscated

Based on work by P1nGu1n
