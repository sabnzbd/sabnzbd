Release Notes - SABnzbd 4.0.0 Alpha 1
=========================================================

## Changes since 3.7.2
- In this major update we replaced a core part of Python's SSL handling
  with our own improved version. This results in large performance increases
  when downloading from news servers with SSL enabled.
  In addition, the general connection handling was overhauled, resulting in
  performance improvements for all news servers.
  Special thanks to: mnightingale, puzzledsab and animetosho!
- When adding a new news server, SSL is enabled by default.
- File assembly performance significantly improved by relying on the
  CRC32 instead of the MD5 to perform QuickCheck of files.
- Slowdown more gracefully when the cache fills up.
- HTTPS files are included in the `Backup`.
- Improved `Watched Folder` scanning and processing.
- Dropped support for Python 3.7.
