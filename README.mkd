Release Notes - SABnzbd 3.3.0 Release Candidate 2
=========================================================

## Changes and bugfixes since 3.3.0 Release Candidate 1
- Failure to start on some platforms.
- Stability improvement to encrypted RAR-detection.
- Allow missing extensions in `Unwanted extensions` detection.
- Removed Special setting `max_art_opt`.
- Prevent jobs getting stuck at 99% due to unreliable servers.

## Changes since 3.2.1
- The `External internet access` will automatically detect local network
  and no longer requires local network ranges to be defined. Custom ranges 
  can still be defined through `local_ranges` in Special settings.
- Allow setting `inet_exposure` from the command line.
- Support prefix and netmask for Special setting `local_ranges`.
- The `Unwanted extensions` detection can be set to `Whitelist`-mode. 
  This will block or pause all jobs with non-matching extensions.
- Servers article statistics are shown in K, G, M-notation.
- Resolution added as a pattern key (`%r`) for Sorting.
- Optimized performance of par2 file parsing.
- CPU usage optimizations in the download process.
- Revised handling of categories, scripts, and priorities when adding NZB's.
- Download statistics are also shown when no History is shown.
- Confirm rename if Direct Unpack is active for the job.
- Obfuscated-RAR detection will always be performed.
- All requests will be logged, not just API calls.
- Windows/macOS: Update UnRar to 6.0.1.
- Windows: Update Multipar to 1.3.1.7 (adds faster verification).

## Bugfixes since 3.2.1
- Prevent failed post-processing if job name ends in multiple dots or spaces.
- Failing articles could result in jobs being stuck at 99%.
- Jobs could be stuck in the queue or duplicate if they had missing articles.
- CRC/yEnc errors would be counted twice as bad articles.
- Some NZB files would incorrectly be marked as empty.
- API-call `history` would not filter active post-processing by `nzo_ids`.
- Login page could be accessed even if `External internet access` was set
  to `No access`. Any other calls would still be blocked.
- Ignore duplicate files inside messy NZB's.
- Windows: `Deobfuscate final filenames` could fail to deobfuscate.
- macOS: Disk space would be incorrect for very large disks.

## Upgrade notices
- The download statistics file `totals10.sab` is updated in 3.2.x 
  version. If you downgrade to 3.1.x or lower, detailed download 
  statistics will be lost.
